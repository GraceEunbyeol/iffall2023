        <h1> Grace Jung Intro Questions </h1>
        <p> 1. My name is Grace Jung, and I am a Junior in Communication Design.</p>
        <p> 2. My background is in illustration and I am taking this class for the major.</p>
        <p> 3. I have almost zero experience with HTML or CSS. I have taken CS131 though, if that counts for anything.</p>
        <p> 4. I hope to understand how websites are made so that I can make something myself.</p>
        <p> 5. Designing on the paper and designing on the screen are different because screens are interactable whereas the paper is only visual. You would have to think about
            how to make the website more clear for the viewer to navigate.

        <p> 6. <a href = https://www.lacoste.com/us/lacoste-heritage.html#golf>lacoste</a> - I simply love the detail of the spinning crocodile in the background that synchs up with the scrolling of the mouse. </p>
        <p> 7. <a href = https://mubasic-test.webflow.io>Mubasic</a> - it's simple and straight to the point. </p>
        <p> 8. <a href = https://unseen.co>unsean</a> - It's well designed and even with all the detail it manages to run well.</p>
